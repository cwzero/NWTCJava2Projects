There are two general ways to access the projects from eclipse.  
The first is just to hit download zip, extract the file and import existing project. 

The second way is to open the git perspective and click the clone button.  

At the top right side of the eclipse window is the button to switch perspectives (next to the java perspective button). 

The clone button is the blue curved arrow in the set of three at the top left of the git perspective, make sure to check the "Import eclipse projects" checkbox in the last page of the dialog.
